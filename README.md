PE01: Assembly LanguagePE01: Assembly Language
Write and test a program that reads in three integers and prints out the sum of the largest two of the three.  
You can break ties arbitrarily.
For example, input = {2, 9, 4} then output should be 13 as 9, 4 are the two largest of three.
Submit your screen shot of output and source code to BB (submission) link. Due on 01/19 11:30PM.
