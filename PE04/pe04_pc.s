# Write and test a recursive program for solving the classic mathematical recreation, the Towers of Hanoi puzzle. 
#(This will require the use of stack frames to support recursion.) The puzzle consists of three pegs (1, 2, and 3) and n disks 
#(the number n can vary; typical values might be in the range from 1 to 8). Disk 1 is smaller than disk 2, 
#which is in turn smaller than disk 3, and so forth, with disk n being the largest. 
#Initially, all the disks are on peg 1, starting with disk n on the bottom, disk n âˆ’ 1 on top of that, and so forth, up to disk 1 on the top. 
#The goal is to move all the disks to peg 2. You may only move one disk at a time, that is, 
#the top disk from any of the three pegs onto the top of either of the other two pegs. Moreover, 
#there is a constraint: You must not place a larger disk on top of a smaller disk.

# Must take int input for n (number of disks)
# Must recursively set each disk less than the one before it
# Must have 3 pegs and all disks start on peg 1 in order of top (smallest aka disk 1) to bottom (largest aka disk n)
